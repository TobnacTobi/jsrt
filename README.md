jsrt README
===

jsrt is a simple to understand Javascript implementation of ray tracing that
was designed mainly to be easy to understand and modify. It only supports
very basic features (spheres and planes are the only objects you can render)
but is fast enough to render small animations in real time.

If you want to see it in action, there is a [demo here](http://antirez.com/misc/rt.html).
